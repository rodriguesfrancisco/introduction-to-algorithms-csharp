# Introduction do Algorithms

# About

A repository to store the codes and annotations on the study of the book **Introduction to Algorithms**.

# How to run

First, the codes are written in C# with the **.netcore SDK 3.1**, so you need this installed in your computer.
Do a cd into the algorithm you want to run, like:

```
cd InsertionSort/
```
Then, inside the folder, do:

```
dotnet run
```
